This is Universal Editor 4.0c (Compact Core), ideal for use in developing specialized frameworks and use with Cosmos-based operating systems.

I am licensing this Universal Editor as GNU Lesser General Public License, permitting its use in nonfree software. The reasoning behind this is pretty simple. It forms only the extremely essential core of Universal Editor, so it does not provide too much specialized functionality that might be better suited to the pure GPL. However, it gives enough functionality that it might encourage users to switch to the "full" Universal Editor when they might need it, furthering the development of free software.
