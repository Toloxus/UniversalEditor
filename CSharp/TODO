Platform:
* Implement UE Packages (*.uepack) in Essential
	* These are ZIP files that contain all the XML and compiled binary files for DataFormats, ObjectModels, etc.
	
* NOTE: Accessors cannot be made runtime-independent since they require interfacing directly with sources of data (e.g. FTP server, local file...); DataFormats and
        ObjectModels should be implemented in markup, but Accessors simply cannot be.

Editor:
* Provide PropertyGridSettings to communicate property changes using the UniversalEditor PropertyGrid control

FileSystemEditor:
* Prevent icon loader from running until DataFormat is finished loading
* Pressing F2 should initiate a "rename" operation (almost every respectable file browser already supports this)
* * Requires additional features in AwesomeControls ListView... specifically, BeginEdit() like WinForms ListView

FARCDataFormat:
* Fix saving (might actually work, see above note about FileSystemEditor and icon loader)

UniversalEditor Projects:
* "Live folders" - project folders are automatically populated with their physical folder contents when project is loaded
	Select folder, set "Live folder" = "True" in Properties panel
	
Project file BuildActions:
	"Compile"
		- Combine multiple selected files into one
		OutputObjectModel = FileSystemObjectModel
		User specifies OutputFileName and OutputDataFormat

Document Tabs:
* Dragging items over document tabs should cause the active tab to switch to the tab being dragged over. As of 2012, Visual Studio does not support this ;)
	* This (dragging text from a text editor across tabs) appears to be fixed in VS2013, or the original post could be about a completely unrelated phenomenon
