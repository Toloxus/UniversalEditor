Editor:
* Provide PropertyGridSettings to communicate property changes using the UniversalEditor PropertyGrid control

FileSystemEditor: Prevent icon loader from running until DataFormat is finished loading

FARC DataFormat - fix saving
* Saving might actually work, see above note about FileSystemEditor and icon loader

"Live folders" - project folders are automatically populated with their physical folder contents when project is loaded
	Select folder, set "Live folder" = "True" in Properties panel
	
Project file BuildActions:
	"Compile"
		- Combine multiple selected files into one
		OutputObjectModel = FileSystemObjectModel
		User specifies OutputFileName and OutputDataFormat

Document Tabs:
* Dragging items over document tabs should cause the active tab to switch to the tab being dragged over. As of 2012, Visual Studio does not support this ;)
